# hack-a-code : till-45-days
#### a positive step towards **Something COOL** :smiley:

This repository is created with the aim to achieve something that most of us crave for, `Satisfaction`. Whether you are already occupied with work or just chilling. The rule here is simple. Code & push for each day till 45 days.

To achieve this, there is a [board of everyday tasks](https://app.asana.com/0/309347631708990/board "asana.com"), where you can assign tasks to anyone or challenge someone with something. Use [this amazing platform](https://www.asana.com "asana.com") & keep track of how each & every member in the team is performing.

Just follow this practice & you will simply feel the difference. The event is going to start from **5th April, 2017** & will continue till next **45 days**.

So, what are you thinking about - stop thinking & start coding :wink:

>```java
>int days = 1;
>while (days++ <= 45) {
>    System.out.println("CODE + PUSH = STAY COOL");
>}
